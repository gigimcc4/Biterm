Using various Topic modeling techniques in R to tease out themes from reviews on the book "Data Feminism."

There are many ways to incorporate Data Feminism principles into everyday research and work. For instance: 

It was clear that the study of intersectional feminism was prevalent in the book reviews. From the top words in the topic, we can see concern about power imbalances, data ethics, and justice when it comes to data science and what data is produced. Feminism is not "only" for cisgender females but for disadvantaged groups except the powerful men of male-dominated societies. We continue to see the inequalities transferred to the digital environment. Data Femisinsm's framework is a good starting point for those in Data Science, Learning Analytics, or any field collecting, disseminating, or engineering data. 

More and more research is emerging on evaluating and examining knowledgeable agents of the digital in social media platforms. Gleaning into social media hashtag communities identifying the self-defined social identities and how the communities navigate a racialized and gendered society. Collecting the raw data from a Twitter hashtag is not enough to analyze the sentiment of a research topic. D'Ignazio and Klein suggest that "one must understand the culture and incorporate an examination of power." Understanding what data to capture and then including or excluding it in the analysisâ€”constantly bringing a feminist lens on who the data impacts or possible harms. 

When seeking grant opportunities incorporating a diversified team will allow for a well-rounded understanding of what treatment you are including. "Power imbalances are everywhere in data science: in our datasets, in our data products, and in the environments that enable our data work" (D'Ignazio and Klein, 2015).

When putting together survey data, try to include the concepts of sexual orientation, gender identity, and sexual expression, depending on the suitability of the study.
